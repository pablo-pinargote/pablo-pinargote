# Hi there !

This is my personal repository, right now I am working on a development framework for what I call my "company" which is called Paranoid Software, it involves the following tech stack:

- MongoDB
- RabbitMQ
- Elasticsearch
- DjangoCMS
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- C#, javascript and Python as main programming languages

Also as part of the framework I have been working on some Django CMS Plugins and a CLI tools to make the work with the CMS a little more entertaining.

Right now I am exploring some techniques to use containers for database related application testing; and also starting to learn and embrace the Open Source Projects Development World. (Have been working on propietary software for too long, practically since I have 15 years old using languages like Fox Pro)

Feel free to take a look at my repos and give some feedback if you want, it will be appreciated.
