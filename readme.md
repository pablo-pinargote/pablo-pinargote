# Hi there !

This is my personal repository, right now I am working on a development framework for what I call my "company" which is called Paranoid Software, it involves the following tech stack:

- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch
- RabbitMQ
- Flask
- djangoCMS
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Google Cloud Run
- Google Cloud Functions

And c#, javascript and python as main programming languages.

Also as part of the framework I have been working on some djangoCMS Plugins and a CLI tools to make the work with the CMS a little bit more entertaining.

Right now I am exploring some techniques to use containers for database related applications testing; and also I am starting to learn and embrace the Open Source Projects Development World. (Have been working on propietary software for too long, practically since I have 15 years old using languages like Fox Pro and Visual Basic)

Feel free to take a look at my repos and give some feedback if you want, it will be appreciated.
